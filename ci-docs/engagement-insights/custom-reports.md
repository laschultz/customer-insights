# Create and edit custom reports

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In addition to out-of-box (OOB) reports, you can build a custom report with chart and table visualizations to help you understand user behavior. This article explains how to create a report with the data you need using table and chart visualizations. For information about OOB reports, see [View reports](view-reports.md).

## Create a custom report

1. Go to **Analyze** > **Custom** to access the custom report list.

1. Select **New report** to start creating a custom report.

1. Decide the type of report you want to build:

    - Select **Add visual** in the command bar to create a default table visualization.
    - Or, select a column, bar, line, area, pie, donut, or table visualization from the **Report editor** pane.

1. In the **Data** section of the **Visualization editor** pane, click the **Metrics** box to choose one of the available options (for example, page views) to display. You can also add **Dimensions** (for example, country) to show on the visualization. For more information, see [View and create metrics](metrics.md) and [View and create dimensions](dimensions.md).

1. Select the **Design** section of the **Visualization editor** pane to add **Title text** and toggle the **Title** on and off.  You can also change the visualization type by selecting another chart, such as **pie chart**.

1. To change the size and position of a visualization:
   - Select the visualization and then drag one of the corners or borders to adjust its size.
   - Select the visualization and move it to a new position. You can also use the arrow keys to change the position.
1. To add another visualization, select **Add visual** in the command bar.
1. After adding the visualizations you want for the report, select **Save** in the command bar.

1. Provide a name for the custom report and select **Save** to create it.
 
### Filter custom reports

You can select the time frame or date range in a custom report to focus on a value or time period.
